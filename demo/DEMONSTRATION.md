# AI Coding Assistant Evaluation Framework - Complete Demonstration

## Scenario: Evaluating Cursor vs GitHub Copilot for Bug Fix Tasks

Let's walk through a complete evaluation comparing how Cursor and GitHub Copilot help with fixing a critical bug in a React application.

### Setup Phase

First, install and initialize the framework:

```bash
# 1. Setup (one-time)
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
source activate.sh
eval-framework init
```

### Part 1: Evaluating Cursor

#### Step 1: Start Evaluation Session
```bash
eval-framework start-session \
  --name "Critical Bug Fix - Cursor Evaluation" \
  --tool cursor \
  --type bug_fix \
  --developer john_doe \
  --watch-path ./my-react-app \
  --enable-monitoring
```

**What happens**: 
- Creates database record for this evaluation session
- Starts monitoring file changes in ./my-react-app
- Begins timing tracking
- Outputs: Session ID and monitoring status

#### Step 2: Begin Development Process
```bash
# Start requirements analysis phase
eval-framework start-phase requirements_analysis
```

**Developer works**: Reads bug report, understands the issue (null pointer exception in user profile component)

```bash
# Log AI interaction for understanding the problem
eval-framework log-ai \
  --prompt "Help me understand this React error: Cannot read property 'avatar' of undefined in UserProfile component" \
  --response "This error occurs when the user object is undefined or null when trying to access user.avatar. You should add null checking..." \
  --type explanation \
  --rating 4 \
  --helpful true \
  --tokens 85
```

```bash
# Complete requirements phase
eval-framework complete-phase
```

**What happens**: Framework logs 8.5 minutes spent in requirements analysis

#### Step 3: Implementation Phase
```bash
eval-framework start-phase debugging
```

**Developer uses Cursor**: 
- Uses Cursor's AI to suggest the fix
- Cursor generates code with proper null checking

```bash
# Log the code generation interaction
eval-framework log-ai \
  --prompt "Fix this React component to handle undefined user object safely" \
  --response "Here's the corrected component with optional chaining and default values..." \
  --type code_generation \
  --rating 5 \
  --helpful true \
  --tokens 210 \
  --cost 0.03 \
  --ai-generated
```

**Framework automatically detects**:
- UserProfile.jsx was modified (15 lines changed)
- Git commit was made
- Build was triggered and succeeded

#### Step 4: Testing Phase
```bash
eval-framework complete-phase
eval-framework start-phase testing
```

**Developer tests the fix**:
- Runs tests, they pass
- Manually verifies the fix works

```bash
# Add milestone for successful fix
eval-framework milestone \
  --name "bug_fixed" \
  --description "Null pointer exception resolved, all tests passing"

eval-framework complete-phase
```

#### Step 5: Session Completion
```bash
# Provide developer feedback
eval-framework feedback
```

**Interactive prompts appear**:
```
Developer Feedback Form
Please rate each aspect from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
Ease of use rating: 5
Code quality rating: 4
Productivity rating: 5
Learning curve rating: 4
Overall satisfaction: 5
Would you recommend this tool? Yes
What did you like? Excellent autocomplete and context awareness
What didn't you like? Sometimes suggestions were overly complex
```

```bash
# End the session
eval-framework end-session --notes "Cursor provided very accurate suggestions for null checking patterns"
```

**Session Summary Displayed**:
```
✅ Session Completed
Duration: 23.4 minutes
Notes: Cursor provided very accurate suggestions for null checking patterns

Session Summary:
Total duration: 23.4 minutes
Files changed: 2
AI interactions: 3
Milestones: 2
```

### Part 2: Evaluating GitHub Copilot

**Reset environment**: Revert code changes, switch to VS Code with Copilot

```bash
# Start second evaluation session
eval-framework start-session \
  --name "Critical Bug Fix - GitHub Copilot Evaluation" \
  --tool github_copilot \
  --type bug_fix \
  --developer john_doe \
  --watch-path ./my-react-app \
  --enable-monitoring
```

**Repeat the exact same process**:
- Same bug to fix
- Same development phases
- Log all AI interactions
- Track timing and file changes
- Provide feedback

**Example differences you might observe**:
- Copilot might take longer to understand context (27.8 minutes total)
- Different suggestion style (inline vs chat-based)
- Different token usage patterns
- Potentially different satisfaction ratings

### Part 3: Analysis and Reports

#### Quick Terminal Analysis
```bash
# Compare the two sessions quickly
eval-framework reports quick-analysis --tool cursor
eval-framework reports quick-analysis --tool github_copilot
```

**Output**:
```
