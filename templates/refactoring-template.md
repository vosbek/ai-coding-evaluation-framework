# Test Case Template: Refactoring Scenario

## Test ID: REFACTOR_001

### Scenario Description
**Title**: `[TO BE DEFINED - Legacy Code Modernization]`

**Complexity**: Medium  
**Expected Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Technologies**: Java Spring Boot, Legacy Code Patterns

### Pre-conditions
- [ ] Golden repository at baseline commit: `[COMMIT_SHA_HERE]`
- [ ] SonarQube baseline scan completed showing technical debt
- [ ] Test suite passing: `[XX/XX tests]`
- [ ] Legacy code component identified for refactoring
- [ ] IDE configured with AI assistant

### Task Description
**Refactoring Objective**: `[SPECIFIC LEGACY CODE TO BE MODERNIZED]`

**Modernization Goals**:
- [ ] Convert to modern Spring Boot patterns
- [ ] Improve code readability and maintainability
- [ ] Reduce cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] Eliminate code smells and technical debt
- [ ] Maintain or improve performance
- [ ] Preserve all existing functionality

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Legacy patterns replaced with modern equivalents
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Code quality metrics improved
- [ ] No functional regressions introduced
- [ ] Code is more maintainable and readable
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary

### Standardized Prompts
**Initial Analysis Prompt**: 
```
"I have this legacy code that needs modernization: [CODE_SNIPPET]. 
Please analyze the current implementation and suggest modern Spring Boot patterns 
that would improve maintainability and performance."
```

**Refactoring Prompts**:
- "Help me convert this to use Spring's dependency injection properly"
- "Refactor this method to reduce complexity and improve readability"
- "Update this code to follow current Java best practices"
- "Add proper error handling and logging"

**Validation Prompts**:
- "Review this refactored code for potential issues"
- "Suggest additional improvements or optimizations"
- "Help me update the corresponding tests"

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity reduced by at least 20%
- [ ] SonarQube technical debt decreased
- [ ] Code duplication eliminated
- [ ] Modern design patterns implemented
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] All unit tests pass without modification
- [ ] Integration tests pass without modification

### Refactoring Targets (Examples)
- [ ] Replace @Autowired field injection with constructor injection
- [ ] Convert XML configuration to annotation-based
- [ ] Modernize exception handling patterns
- [ ] Update deprecated API usage
- [ ] Implement proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Add appropriate design patterns (Strategy, Factory, etc.)

### Metrics to Capture
- Code quality improvement (SonarQube scores)
- Complexity reduction percentage
- Lines of code changed/removed
- Number of code smells eliminated
- Performance impact (if measurable)
- Time to complete refactoring
- Number of AI interactions required

### Before/After Comparison
**Before Refactoring**:
- [ ] Complexity score: `[BASELINE_SCORE]`
- [ ] Technical debt: `[BASELINE_DEBT]`
- [ ] Code coverage: `[BASELINE_COVERAGE]`
- [ ] Performance metrics: `[BASELINE_PERFORMANCE]`

**After Refactoring**:
- [ ] Complexity score: `[NEW_SCORE]`
- [ ] Technical debt: `[NEW_DEBT]`
- [ ] Code coverage: `[NEW_COVERAGE]`
- [ ] Performance metrics: `[NEW_PERFORMANCE]`

### Developer Assessment Questions
1. How well did the AI understand the legacy code context?
2. Were the suggested modern patterns appropriate?
3. Did the AI maintain backward compatibility concerns?
4. Rate the quality of refactoring suggestions (1-10)
5. Any unexpected challenges with AI-guided refactoring?

### Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Create backup branch before refactoring
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite after each change
- [ ] Monitor for performance regressions
- [ ] Validate business logic preservation
- [ ] Check for security implications

### Environment Reset Checklist
- [ ] Git reset to baseline commit
- [ ] All temporary branches removed
- [ ] IDE workspace cleaned
- [ ] SonarQube analysis reset
- [ ] Test results cleared
- [ ] Logging system ready for next test
