# Test Case Template: New Feature Implementation

## Test ID: FEATURE_001

### Scenario Description
**Title**: `[TO BE DEFINED - New Feature for Golden Repository]`

**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Expected Duration**: 45-75 minutes  
**Technologies**: Java Spring Boot, Angular, Oracle Database

### Pre-conditions
- [ ] Golden repository at baseline commit: `[COMMIT_SHA_HERE]`
- [ ] SonarQube baseline scan completed
- [ ] Test suite passing: `[XX/XX tests]`
- [ ] Angular frontend running locally
- [ ] Backend API accessible
- [ ] IDE configured with AI assistant

### Task Description
**Feature Requirements**: `[DETAILED FEATURE SPECIFICATION TO BE ADDED]`

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] New REST API endpoint(s)
- [ ] Frontend UI components
- [ ] Database schema changes (if needed)
- [ ] Input validation and error handling
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] API documentation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature works as specified in requirements
- [ ] All new endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Frontend properly displays data and handles errors
- [ ] Database operations are secure and efficient
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new code
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accurate

### Standardized Prompts
**Initial Prompt**: 
```
"I need to implement a new feature: [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]. 
This should include [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]. 
Please help me design and implement this feature following Spring Boot best practices."
```

**Backend Development Prompts**:
- "Create a REST controller for [FEATURE_NAME] with CRUD operations"
- "Help me design the entity model and repository layer"
- "Implement proper validation and error handling"

**Frontend Development Prompts**:
- "Create an Angular component to display [DATA_TYPE]"
- "Implement form validation and submit functionality"
- "Add proper error handling and user feedback"

**Testing Prompts**:
- "Generate unit tests for the [COMPONENT_NAME] class"
- "Create integration tests for the [ENDPOINT_NAME] endpoint"

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature functions correctly end-to-end
- [ ] All new code has >80% test coverage
- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Frontend is responsive and user-friendly
- [ ] No existing functionality is broken
- [ ] Code quality standards are maintained
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

### Technical Deliverables
- [ ] Controller class with proper annotations
- [ ] Service layer with business logic
- [ ] Repository/DAO for data access
- [ ] Entity/DTO classes
- [ ] Angular component and service
- [ ] Unit tests for all layers
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Database migration scripts (if needed)

### Metrics to Capture
- Time from requirements to working feature
- Number of AI interactions across all components
- Code complexity metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Number of bugs found during testing
- Frontend performance metrics
- API response times

### Developer Assessment Questions
1. How well did the AI understand the full-stack requirements?
2. Did the AI suggest appropriate architectural patterns?
3. How consistent was code quality across different prompts?
4. Rate the efficiency of AI-generated tests (1-10)
5. Any issues with AI context switching between frontend/backend?

### Environment Reset Checklist
- [ ] Git reset to baseline commit
- [ ] Database schema restored
- [ ] Angular dev server restarted
- [ ] Backend application restarted
- [ ] IDE workspace cleaned
- [ ] All generated files removed
- [ ] Logging system ready for next test
