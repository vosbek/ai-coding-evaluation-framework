# Test Case Template: Bug Fix Scenario

## Test ID: BUG_FIX_001

### Scenario Description
**Title**: `[TO BE DEFINED - Specific Bug in Golden Repository]`

**Complexity**: Medium  
**Expected Duration**: 30-45 minutes  
**Technologies**: Java Spring Boot, Oracle Database

### Pre-conditions
- [ ] Golden repository at baseline commit: `[COMMIT_SHA_HERE]`
- [ ] SonarQube baseline scan completed
- [ ] Test suite passing: `[XX/XX tests]`
- [ ] Local Oracle database running
- [ ] IDE configured with AI assistant

### Task Description
**Problem Statement**: `[SPECIFIC BUG DESCRIPTION TO BE ADDED]`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Bug is completely resolved
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] No new code quality issues introduced
- [ ] Solution follows company coding standards
- [ ] Appropriate error handling implemented

### Standardized Prompts
**Initial Prompt**: 
```
"I need to fix a bug in [COMPONENT_NAME] where [PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION]. 
The issue occurs when [TRIGGER_CONDITIONS]. 
Please help me identify the root cause and implement a fix."
```

**Follow-up Prompts** (if needed):
- "Can you explain why this solution works?"
- "Are there any edge cases I should consider?"
- "Can you help me write tests for this fix?"

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Bug reproduction steps no longer cause the issue
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] SonarQube quality gates pass
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities introduced

### Metrics to Capture
- Time from start to working solution
- Number of AI interactions required
- Code changes (lines added/modified/deleted)
- Test coverage impact
- Code quality score changes
- Number of compilation errors
- Number of test failures during development

### Developer Assessment Questions
1. How intuitive were the AI suggestions?
2. Did the AI understand the context correctly?
3. How many iterations were needed to get working code?
4. Rate the quality of the final solution (1-10)
5. Any unexpected challenges or AI limitations?

### Environment Reset Checklist
- [ ] Git reset to baseline commit
- [ ] Database state restored
- [ ] IDE workspace cleaned
- [ ] All temporary files removed
- [ ] Logging system ready for next test
